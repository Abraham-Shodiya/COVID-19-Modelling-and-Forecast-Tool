* Inaccurate data prediction

* * * Our prediction that we have to create for the NHS could be slightly or extremely off which in turn will give the NHS bad data.


* The impact this risk could have on for the NHS is severe as they need to have accurate data to take the correct measures in controlling the rapid growth of COVID-19. The data we produce for the NHS has a great bearing on the measures taken. 


* The stories have been assigned to Abraham and have been completed.
