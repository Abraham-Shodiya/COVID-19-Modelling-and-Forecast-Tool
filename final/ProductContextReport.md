##Legal Issues
An important legal issues in relation to the NHS application is data. This is because we need to ensure that none of the data we collect breaches any of the issues surrounding the General Data Protection Regulation. This is problematic because, if we do not comply with the relevant regulation we could be liable to stiff penalties and severe cases such as the removal of a company from CompaniesHouse. 

##Licenses needed for the application
In relation, to licenses needed for the NHS application, I believe a Data Protection Licence from the ICO(Information Commisioners' Office ) would be necessary because it would help with legally processing personal information such as gender, age, ethnicity, location etc for the cases and deaths on the platform. 

##Data Protection Laws that we need to be aware of
The Data Protection Laws that is most relevant to us is General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR) because, if not complied with and users end up finding out that the NHS application did not end up using their personal data correctly it could result in users as well as external parties (non-users) taking the business to court (via sue'ing) for breaking their consent and personal data.

##Ethical Issues
A significant ethical issue that could arise with our NHS application is confidentiality. This is because, it is going to be largely assumed that when the user(s) such as employees within the NHS or just a regular 9-5 full-time worker with 2 children inputs their personal information like location to check the cases and deaths within their local area that it would be put confidentially and also, that themselves (as a user/users) would remain annoymous when navigating around the area in which they're checking the cases and deaths. Also, this could be problematic because a user might be worried with who else has access to see what their recent history was.

##Health and Safety Issues

A health and safety issue that could revolve around the NHS application is health problems. For example, for the employees at the business of the NHS application could get nausus when recording data for how many COVID-19 deaths they were in a certain location or even multiple areas or just dealing with the ideas of collecting deaths in general relating to COVID-19.This could arise from, the employees feeling anxious or nervous (creating clammy hands) or even just feeling uncomfortable because they might have lost a close family member or friend to the COVID-19 virus and thus, making them unstable.
